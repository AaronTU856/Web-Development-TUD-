            <h3>The Fair Green</h3>
              <img src="Images/carnavel.jpg"     alt="carnavel" />
              <p>Like all fair greens throughout the country this was used as a central gathering point in the town for trade and events. In the 1920's and 30's Clara had a wide range of trade and amenities on offer such as merchants, butchers, grocers, blacksmiths and a drapery store. These were situated around the fair green and so focused much of the towns footfall there. An example of an event held on the fair green would be the “Clara Carnival”, this was advertised as a “Colossal Marquee Dancing Attraction”. This festival ran from the 3rd of June to the 19th June 1955.

                  <p>Clara's street scape is a reflection of its own history. Clara is very fortunate that it has a railway station which allowed for easy access to the town as a result many business owners had their eyes on this small town. Clara soon became one of the most important industrial towns in the midlands in the late 1800's as it led the way in terms of its innovation and its services. remnants of the great industrial history of Clara can still be seen today such as the impressive Erry mill.</p>

                <p> The Clara train station was opened in 1859 due to an expansion westward from Portarlington to Athlone.The building of the railway in Clara was to bring significant social and economic changes to the town. 
                    <br>                 
                The clara line proved so popular that it was expanded not once but twice. The first extension was northwards towards Streamstown to connect with the Dublin - Mullingar MGWR line, and the second was a new branch line heading southwest to Banagher via Ferbane. <br>
                  
                Unfortunately, neither line remains in use, and actual evidence of both, particularly the Banagher line can be hard to find. Clara's    transportation links were further expanded in the late 1800's with the creation of an additional branch line between Clara and Banagher. This line connected to the current Clara - Galway line just beyond the underpass at Erry / off the Ballycumber road (beside Kinahan's farm). The remains of this line are visible in parts along the way to Ferbane and beyond to Banagher. Unfortunately on the 30th October, 1962 CIE announced in the national papers that they intended to shut down a number of regional lines including the Banagher - Clara line.
                  
                In a detailed article, the Offaly Independent in January 1963 wrote about the closure of the Banagher-Clara line and also the Birr-Roscrea line, which had a devastating effect on South West Offaly. In its report: The Offaly Independent remarked on a number of similarities between the two lines, in particular the fact that the Banagher and Birr lines terminated close to significant military stations occupied by “Soldiers of the Crown” in Banagher and Crinkle.</p>

                      <h3>The Historical Interest Factors of the proposed ACA:</h3> 

            
                <li><p>Clara started as a typical Irish rural settlement with ring forts and by the mid 18th – century its development was dominated by the linen industry. In 1825, Charlestown and Erry Mills, located on the Brosna River were bought by the Quaker business partners Robert Goodbody and Anthony Pim, and thus set in motion the establishment of the town in following years as a historically important industrial centre. Erry Mill holds pride of place in being the only example of a roller mill in County Offaly and functions as a prominent landscape feature in Clara, with its location on the river. Of Charlestown Mill, only the grain store, which was built in 1853 has survived the ravages of time and even in its current dilapidated state, it proudly bears witness to the once illustrious industrial past of Clara.</p></li>
                        <br><br>
                <li><p>The mid to late 19th – century saw the industrialisation of the town with the building of the Clashawaun Jute Works in 1864 by Jonathan and Lewis Frederic Goodbody on the western outskirts of the town. Jute was imported from India and in 1865 spinning & weaving officially commenced to produce sacks, with the employment of 82 employees, (62 females & 20 males) and by 1900 employment had exceeded 600, including 230 female employees. The industrial age brought steam power in 1870, electricity in 1900 and telephones in 1904 to the town and its mills. Clara at the time epitomised the zeitgeist of the industrial age, a time when innovators dared to dream big and take great risks, either by devising new inventions or finding ways to make existing products more efficient, case in point the importation of jute from India to replace flax. The Clashawaun Jute Works holds significant historical interest as it is the only jute mill in Ireland and the only purpose-built mill village in County Offaly. By 1873, under the patronage of the Goodbody family, a 120 experimental workers houses had been constructed, using a roof system from Portlaw. The philanthropic model settlement was designed for the benefit and welfare of the workers and what remains of the Clashawaun Jute Works, to this day adds interest to the surrounding landscape due to its rarity and river setting.</p></li>	
                          <br><br>
                <li><p>Of great historic interest and inextricably linked to the Clashawaun Jute Works, Charlestown & Erry Mills and arguably the most prosperous time in Clara’s history to date, is Inchmore House. This landmark building was designed by the noted Victorian Irish Architect, John Skipton Mulvany for the patriarch of the Quaker Merchant family in Clara, Robert Goodbody. Guglielmo Marconi spent a period of 12 months at Inchmore House as a guest of Robert Goodbody. It is well documented that he was perfecting the Telegram at the time and the Marconi Telecom Company was formed in the front room of Inchmore House after the first successful product testing.</p></li>
                            <br><br>
                <li><p>Clara was well suited for the textile industry, with the coming of the railways in 1859 which allowed for import/export opportunities and ready access to running water from the Brosna River to operate the mills. As a consequence, Clara was one of only a small number of towns in Ireland which increased in size and underwent an economic, social and physical transformation.</p></li> 
                              <br><br>
                <li><p>The self-contained nature of the town meant that a range of services and facilities were established to cater for the needs of the ever increasing populous and a variety of shopfronts are still intact on River Street, Main Street and Church Street.  These are of historic interest in their own right, as is the detached cruciform gable-fronted Roman Catholic Church built in 1881 to accommodate worshipper numbers.</p> </li> 
                                <br><br>
                <li><p>Clara was wholly dependent upon the textile industry for prosperity and regrettably in the 20th – century the trade declined significantly. In 1971, after 106 years, jute spinning and weaving came to an end at the Clashawaun Jute Works. In October of 1984, J. & L. F. Goodbody Ltd went into receivership with the unfortunate result in coming years of the mills becoming vacant and disused to the detriment of the surrounding area and the town as a whole.</li></p>

    <p>The predominant architectural character of the proposed ACA in Clara is determined by the industrial built heritage of the 19th century and offers the full hierarchy of building types associated with this system. This hierarchy comprises of the mills & associated structures, a mill pond, the mill owner’s house & garden as well as intergenerational mill workers’ housing. It furthermore contains various religious buildings which bear witness to the importance of organised religion at this time and several commercial buildings which are still in use or have been in use until well into the 20th century.</p>
