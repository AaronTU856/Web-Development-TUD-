      <p>On 15th December, 1884, the Clara Hurling Club was affiliated to the newly founded Gaelic Athletic Association. It has been widely accepted that Clara was the first club in the provinces to become affiliated. 
      The very first would appear to have been Metropolitans, a club organised by Michael Cusack with a membership drawn mainly from civil servants and students attending Cusack's academy in Gardiner Place, Dublin. The first President of the Clara club was PJ.  White, whom an early history of the Association describes as "the most active pioneer of the GAA movement in his district in the eighties. </p>
        
      <p>P.J. White had already been active in the National movement for many years, As such he had come under the attention of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin Castle, and according to police reports he joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood around 1874. His grocery and licensed premises in Main Street was regarded by the RIC as a place where "Fenianism was strongly carried on" and he was regarded as instrumental in introducing John Clery, who was afterwards to the fore in nationalist activities in Mullingar and Tullamore in the 1880s, in the IRB.</p>
        
      <p>Clery had served his apprenticeship in the bar and grocery trade with P.J. White between 1875 and 1879 White was unsuccessfully prosecuted in March 1881 for displaying flags at his licensed premises and he was imprisoned in October 1881 at Naas jail under the Protection of Person and Property Act 1881. He had also been active in the Land League as secretary of the Clara  branch and attended a number of meetings of the Central Land League between February and October 1881, when the League was suppressed.</p>

          <p>Clara has produced a number of books that relate the history and folklore of the town, one such book is Vincent Henry’s “One Last Bend”. The book charts the personal history of his father Peter Henry and his travelling shop, recounting characters and events from the mid 1940’s to the beginning of the 1980’s.</p>

          <p>Local Community groups connected by the River Brosna are coming together to celebrate the cultural and natural heritage of the river by hosting a Literary and Music Festival during Heritage Week 2022 at Clara House. On Saturday, August 20th River Brosna Literary & Music Festival will take place along the banks of the beautiful river Brosna in in Clara, Co, Offaly. The event is hosted and coordinated by The Clara Heritage Society, and supported by the Tidy Towns groups from Ballycumber, Pullough and Ferbane.
          The festival will feature a performance from the Brosna Suite, which was composed by Carole Nelson in collaboration with local musicians and inspired by the river. The Brosna Suite was a Creative Ireland funded project in 2021, and each new performance is a unique improvisation and collaboration. Lizz Kelly will feature on harp and violin, and other musicians are invited to join in. Celebrating the spoken word, an integral part of our culture, poetry will be recited by poets from across the region. Poems depicting life along the river, poems from the Hogan collection and poems chosen by individuals will feature in the programme. The event will be proceeded by afternoon workshops, where children will have the opportunity to explore music and the spoken word. Light refreshments will be served at the end.
          Though under cover this is an outdoor event. It will also be filmed and shared on social media.</p>
