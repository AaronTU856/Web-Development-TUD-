          <p>In 1825, the Goodbody family moved to Clara from Mountmellick and introduced industry into the town, trading under the name of J&LF Goodbody. Buying flour mills at Erry and Charlestown, they developed the river Brosna and used it to harness power for their factories. In 1864 the Goodbody's started a jute factory at Clashawaun. The jute was imported from India and the resulting bags were exported worldwide. In the last decades of the 20th century the factories declined and the last Goodbody's factory closed in 1984. The family had provided the people of Clara with employment in a number of areas: factory work, domestic service and farming. Other industries in the town included flour mills, distilleries, a brewery, manufacturers of tobacco, soap, candles and clothes together with food processing companies.</p>

          <p>As the town entered a heyday at the end of the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries, its prosperity led to a number of building projects. Stately houses litter the town and surrounding countryside as the various members of the Goodbody family set up their households. Thanks to Catholic Emancipation in 1829 a more prominent Catholic church was built on the outskirts of the town in Charlestown, but this proved too small and in the 1880's the parish, now St Brigid's Parish, built a fine neo-gothic church in the centre of the town. To cater for the needs of the townspeople, two religious orders founded communities and schools: the Franciscan Brothers arrived in 1821 and the Sisters of Mercy some years later. Other religious buildings in the town consist of St Brigid's parish church for the Church of Ireland Community (Anglican Communion) looking down over the Fair Green and Friends' Meeting Hall (Quaker) which is no longer in use. As the town prospered so did social Life. Numerous cultural and sporting associations flourished in the town and continue to do so to this day.</p>
